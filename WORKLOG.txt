2026-02-13 - Fix Windows (Flutter) build + clean analyzer

Problem
- Windows build failed with CMake errors from FlutterFire `firebase_core` on Windows:
  - Missing `windows/flutter/ephemeral/generated_config.cmake` after clean / not generated yet.
  - Firebase C++ SDK download/extract issues caused missing targets/libs (e.g. `firebase_app.lib`),
    leading to cascaded CMake errors.
- IDE showed many Dart analyzer items (unused locals, TODOs, deprecated API usage, and control flow issues).

Resolution
- Restored a reliable Windows build by ensuring the Firebase C++ SDK is available locally and stable:
  - Cached the SDK under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\PME_TPE\\firebase_cpp_sdk_windows_12.7.0\\firebase_cpp_sdk_windows`
    and set `FIREBASE_CPP_SDK_DIR` so CMake uses the local copy instead of downloading into `build/`.
  - Verified `flutter build windows` succeeds.
- Fixed Dart analyzer/lints so `flutter analyze` is clean.
- Removed in-repo SDK artifacts from `app/build/windows/x64` (zip + extracted folder) to keep the repo clean.

Key techniques / code changes
- Added PowerShell helpers:
  - `app/tools/ensure_firebase_cpp_sdk.ps1`:
    - Downloads/extracts the SDK once using BITS (or copies from the old build cache if present).
    - Writes/sets `FIREBASE_CPP_SDK_DIR` when requested.
  - `app/tools/build_windows.ps1`:
    - Ensures SDK is present, sets env var, runs `flutter build windows`.
- IDE integration:
  - `app/.vscode/settings.json` sets `cmake.configureEnvironment` + `cmake.buildEnvironment` with `FIREBASE_CPP_SDK_DIR`
    so VS Code CMake Tools can configure/build without manual env setup.
- Documentation:
  - `app/README.md` documents the Windows build command using the script.
- Dart code hygiene:
  - Removed unused locals, replaced TODO-only handlers with minimal behavior where appropriate,
    removed `return` inside `finally` by using `if (mounted) setState(...)`,
    replaced deprecated `withOpacity` with `withAlpha`,
    replaced unnecessary underscore callback params with `_`.

2026-02-13 - Fix Git push (HTTP 408) + GitHub push-protection block

Problem
- `git push -u origin main` failed with:
  - `RPC failed; HTTP 408` / unexpected disconnect.
- After removing the huge payload, GitHub rejected the push with GH013 push protection:
  - Secrets detected in `docs/summary2_of_all_done.txt` (Google OAuth Client ID + Client Secret).

Root cause
- The local commits that were being pushed contained very large build artifacts under `build/`
  (Firebase C++ SDK zip + extracted `.lib` files and build outputs). This made the push extremely large,
  causing timeouts over HTTPS.
- GitHub push protection blocks any push that contains secrets in any commit being pushed (even if later
  commits delete/redact them).

Resolution
- Identified the largest blobs in the outgoing commit range using:
  - `git rev-list --objects origin/main..main` + `git cat-file --batch-check` (sorted by object size).
- Rewrote local history (without rewriting remote history) by recreating a clean snapshot commit on top
  of `origin/main` using `git commit-tree`, then `git reset --hard` to that new commit.
  - This removed `build/` artifacts from the outgoing history entirely.
- Redacted OAuth values in `docs/summary2_of_all_done.txt`, then recreated the snapshot commit again so
  the secrets never appear in any pushed commit.
- Push succeeded after rewrite and redaction.

Key techniques / commands
- Large object audit:
  - `git rev-list --objects origin/main..main` + `git cat-file --batch-check`
- History cleanup without sending bad commits:
  - `git commit-tree <tree> -p origin/main -m "<msg>"` then `git reset --hard <new_sha>`
- Secret redaction:
  - Replace client IDs/secrets with `<REDACTED>` in `docs/summary2_of_all_done.txt`.
